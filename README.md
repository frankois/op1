# OP1

## Firmwares
Here are stored the modified firmwares I generated using the [op1repacker](https://github.com/op1hacks/op1repacker). All of the firmwares I host have been tested on my personal OP1, but that does not guarantee it is without any risk.

For each version, I will store:

- `op1_xxx.op1`: original firmware from Teenage Engineering
- `op1_xxx-repacked.op1`: modified firmware with all the modifications enabled
- `op1_xx/`: unpacked firmware folder, containing the modifications
